Using all of our experiences traveling the world, we strove for a level of service that is reflective of the ideal luxury stay that we all relish. It was a long journey with its share of ups and downs, but we are now happy to share our new home (yes, we live here) with a passion to help guests feel an authentic connection to Oregon and the uniqueness of the Eola-Amity Hills."

Talkeetna local and expert log builder Scott Holcomb headed up the project with his unique hand crafted style and set the ridge beam in 1999. Just under the highest eve is the inscription “S.H. 1999” which serves as Scott’s signature on this magnificent piece of architectural art. Exposed mortise and tenon joinery and ornamental steel hangers forged by Talkeetna artist Rob Holt complete the unique and clean aesthetic that runs throughout every corner of the masterfully crafted bed and breakfast."
